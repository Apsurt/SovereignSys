# SovereignSys API

## Overview

The SovereignSys API is a project that simulates the management of a micronation. This FastAPI-based application provides endpoints for citizen registration, passport issuance, law creation, and more. It's designed to showcase how a RESTful API can be used to manage the complex operations of a small, self-declared nation.

## Features (When Finished)

- Country creation: Create multiple countries to simulate your world
- Citizen Registry: Register and manage citizens
- Virtual Passport System: Issue and verify digital passports
- Economy System: Create currencies and markets
- Legal Framework: Create and store laws

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Apsurt/SovereignSys.git
   cd SovereignSys
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the API locally:

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```
   fastapi dev SovereignSys/main.py
   ```

2. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

3. Access the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## API Example Endpoints

- `POST /`: 
- `GET /`: 

For full documentation on request/response formats, please refer to the API documentation at `/docs` when the server is running.

## Example Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the API with curl:

1. Create a new citizen:
   ```
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/"
   ```

2. Issue a passport:
   ```
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/"
   ```

3. Create a new law:
   ```
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/"
   ```
